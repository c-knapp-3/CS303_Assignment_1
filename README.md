Assumptions:
- I read data in from file and made into a linear array
- array is of size 150, data read in from file is in the range of indices 0-99, then zeros are added to be used as placeholders (from indices 100-149)
- user enters integer inputs when asked for indices and numbers
- the function findNumber() only finds the first instance of the chosen number if it exists
